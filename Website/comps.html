  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  <h2>Q:Am I fast enough to go to a competition?</h2>
      <p>A:Your speed should not be a factor in your decision. If you think you may want to go to a competition, go.
        nobody will care about your speed, or your mains, or your method, or anything.
  <h2>Q:What do I need to know before my first competition?</h2>
        <p>A: You can watch this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPL3eV-A0ww">here</a>
          for all of the necessary information.
<h2>Q: How many cubes should I bring?</h2>
<p>A: Don't bring your whole collection, bring your mains and backup mains if possible. There may be a few cubes that you aren't competing in that you know you want to bring snd solve.</p>
<h2>Q: Is competing difficult or stressful?</h2>
<p>A: If you attend the competition tutorials and watch competitions from home, you should be good.</p>
<h2>Q: What if I can't talk to people?</h2>
<p>A: Just walk in, sit down, and ask a few people about their mains and
  averages and other cubing stuff. Try to be social and you'll make new friends!</p>

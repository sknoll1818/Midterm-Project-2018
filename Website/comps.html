  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  <h2>Q:Am I fast enough to go to a competition?</h2>
  <p>A:Your speed should not be a factor in your decision. If you think you may want to go to a competition, go.
    nobody will care about your speed, or your mains, or your method, or anything.
    <h2>Q:What do I need to know before my first competition?</h2>
    <p>A: You can watch this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPL3eV-A0ww">here</a>
      for all of the necessary information.
      <h2>Q: How many cubes should I bring?</h2>
      <p>A: Don't bring your whole collection, bring your mains and backup mains
        if possible. There may be a few cubes that you aren't competing in that you know you want to bring snd solve; you should also bring those.</p>
      <h2>Q: Is competing difficult or stressful?</h2>
      <p>A: Competing is only stressful if you put pressure on yourself. For a first competition, you have no reason to put stress on yourself.
      Instead, focus on the people. If you don't get the results you wanted, you have many more oppurtunities.</p>
      <h2>Q: What if I can't talk to people?</h2>
      <p>A: That is a normal thing to worry about. Don't be afraid to talk to people.
        Odds are, they will be friendly, and invite you in to their friend group. </p>
